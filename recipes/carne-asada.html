    <h2>ðŸ¥© Carne Asada</h2>
    <p>The <em>carne asada<em> is the ultimate celebration of bold, smoky flavor and tender texture. The steak is marinated in a zesty blend of lime juice, orang, garlic, and cilantro, giving each bite a burst of fresh citrus and savory spice. Grilled to perfection, the meat develops beautiful char marks on the outside while staying juicy and pink inside â€” the perfect balance of sear and tenderness.</p>
    <p>Serve this <em>carne asada</em> sliced thin and sizzling hot. It's delicious on its own, but truly shines in tacos, burritos, or rice bowls topped with avocado, pico de gallo, and a squeeze of lime. Whether you're hosting a backyard cookout or just craving a taste of authentic Mexican street flavor, this recipe promises to deliver pure, mouthwatering satisfaction.</p>
