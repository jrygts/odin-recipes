    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The <em>carne asada<em> is the ultimate celebration of bold, smoky flavor and tender texture. The steak is marinated in a zesty blend of lime juice, orang, garlic, and cilantro, giving each bite a burst of fresh citrus and savory spice. Grilled to perfection, the meat develops beautiful char marks on the outside while staying juicy and pink inside — the perfect balance of sear and tenderness.</p>
    <p>Serve this <em>carne asada</em> sliced thin and sizzling hot. It's delicious on its own, but truly shines in tacos, burritos, or rice bowls topped with avocado, pico de gallo, and a squeeze of lime. Whether you're hosting a backyard cookout or just craving a taste of authentic Mexican street flavor, this recipe promises to deliver pure, mouthwatering satisfaction.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Olive Oil.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Lime Juice.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Orange Juice.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>White Wine Vinegar.</strong><em> Apple cider vinegar is good too.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Chili Peppers</strong><em>Use serrano peppers for a spicier version, jalapenos for a milder version.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Garlic and Onion.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Fresh Chopped Cilantro</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Spices.</strong><em>Cumin, oregano, sea salt, black pepper, ancho powder (optional, my personal favorite).</em></li>
    <li><strong>Skirt or Flank Steak.</strong><em>You can use other cuts of steak. See below.</em></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine olive oil, lime juice, orange juice, and white wine vinegar. Whisk until the liquids are well blended.</li>
    <li>Add finely chopped chili peppers, minced garlic, diced onion, and fresh chopped cilantro to the marinade. Stir to mix the aromatics evenly.</li>
    <li>Season the mixture with cumin, oregano, sea salt, black pepper, and a pinch on ancho chili powder if you'd like a smoky depth of flavor.</li>
    <li>Place the skirt or flank steak in alarge resealable bag or shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the meat, making sure it's completely coated.</li>
    <li>Seal or cover, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours — ideally overnight — to allow the flavors to soak deep into the steak.</li>
    <li>When ready to cook, preheat your grill to high heat (about 450-500°F). Lightly oil the grates to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li>Remove the steake from the marinade and let excess liquid drip off. Grill the stea for about 4-6 minutes per side, depending on thickness, until nicely charred on the outside and medium-rare to medium inside.</li>
    <li>Transfer the cooked steak to a cutting board and let rest 5-10 minutes so the juices redistribute.</li>
    <li>Slice the carne asada thinly against the grain for maximum tenderness.</li>
    <li>Serve hot with warm tortillas, fresh lime wedges, pico de gallo, avocado slices, or rice and beans on the side.</li>
